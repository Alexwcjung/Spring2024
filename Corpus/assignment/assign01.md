# Reading Lesson Assignment

## Objective
Create a Markdown (MD) file for a reading lesson using a selected text. Include a word cloud of the text, a word frequency list, and instructions on how to use them in your lesson. The lesson should last 5 to 10 minutes with brief inclass activities.

## Instructions

1. **Select the Reading Material:** Choose a short text from your preferred source (textbook, article, etc.), approximately one to two paragraphs long.

2. **Create the Markdown File:** Start a new MD file using any text editor (e.g., Notepad, Github, or plain text file editor).

3. **Insert the Text:** Copy and paste the selected text into your MD file, formatting it as needed.

4. **Generate a Word Cloud:** Use a word cloud generator (e.g., WordClouds.com) to create a word cloud based on the text. Insert the generated image into your MD file.

```
# Note: copy the image file link from the web address line, and replace 'blob' with 'raw'

```

5. **Create a Word Frequency List:** Manually list the most frequently occurring words in the text, including word and frequency count.

6. **Write Instructions:** In your MD file, provide instructions for using the word cloud and word frequency list in the lesson. Explain their purpose and suggest interactive activities or discussions.

7. **Lesson Plan:** Develop a brief lesson plan that includes:
   - Introduction to the text and context.
   - Engaging activities or questions related to the text.
   - How to incorporate the word cloud and word frequency list.
   - Estimated lesson duration (5-10 minutes).

8. **Proofread and Format:** Review your MD file for errors in formatting, spelling, and grammar. Ensure it's well-organized.

9. **Submission:** Submit your completed MD file as your assignment.

### Evaluation Criteria
Your assignment will be assessed based on:
- Appropriateness of the selected text.
- Clarity and organization of the MD document.
- Quality of the word cloud and word frequency list.
- Effectiveness of the instructions for using these visualizations.
- Creativity and engagement in the brief lesson plan.

**Note:** Reference external sources and tools used in your assignment.
