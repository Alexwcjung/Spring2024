# üçÉ Online Corpus

Online corpora are valuable resources for natural language research and English education. They provide extensive collections of texts and spoken language examples that can be used for linguistic analysis, language learning, and teaching. 

**Corpora** can be categorized based on various criteria, each serving different research and educational purposes. Here are some common ways to categorize corpus types:

+ By Language Content

Monolingual Corpora: Contain text or speech in a single language. Example: The British National Corpus (BNC).
Bilingual or Multilingual Corpora: Include texts in two or more languages, often used for comparative linguistics and translation studies.

+By Time or Text Type

Diachronic (Historical) Corpora: Comprise texts from different time periods to study language evolution. Example: The Corpus of Historical American English (COHA).
Synchronic Corpora: Contain data from a specific, relatively short time period.

+ By Mode of Communication

Spoken Corpora: Consist of transcriptions of spoken language. Example: Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English.
Written Corpora: Contain written texts, which could be fiction, non-fiction, academic, etc.
Multimodal Corpora: Include data from multiple modes, such as speech, text, and video.

+ By Genre or Register

General Corpora: Cover a wide range of genres or registers for a balanced view of the language. Example: COCA.
Specialized Corpora: Focus on a specific genre or register, like academic language, legal documents, medical transcripts, etc.

+ By Annotation

Annotated Corpora: Include additional information like parts of speech, syntactic structure, etc. Example: Penn Treebank.
Non-Annotated Corpora: Consist only of raw text or speech data.

+ By Purpose

Reference Corpora: Designed to represent a language or variety of language as a standard.
Monitor Corpora: Continuously compiled to track language changes over time.
 
+By Size

Large Corpora: Contain a vast amount of data, useful for statistical analysis and NLP.
Small Corpora: More focused, often used for qualitative analyses.
+ By Source

Web Corpora: Compiled from web sources, reflecting contemporary language usage. Example: Corpus of Web-Based Global English (GloWbE).
Corpora from Specific Sources: Such as newspapers, academic journals, or literary texts.
