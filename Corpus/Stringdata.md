# Handling String and Text Data in Python

In this guide, we'll explore how to handle strings and text data in Python. This is a fundamental skill in Python programming, especially useful in data processing, web development, and automation.

## What is a String in Python?

A string in Python is a sequence of characters. It can include letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). Strings are enclosed in quotes, either single (`' '`) or double (`" "`).
