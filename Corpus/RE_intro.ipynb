One particular case for using the wildcard with a repeater would be to target all emails under a certain domain. For example, the regular expression .*@hallme.com would match any email with the hallme.com domain, since the wildcard ( . ) means that any character is valid and the asterisk ( * ) means that they can appear any number of times.
