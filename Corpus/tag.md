## Understanding the Concept of 'Tag' in a Corpus

In corpus linguistics, a 'tag' is a label assigned to elements within the corpus to provide more information about those elements. These tags can denote various attributes like parts of speech, meaning, pronunciation, etc. Tags help in linguistic analysis and are particularly useful in fields like natural language processing (NLP).

### Example

Consider the word "word" as an element in our corpus. We can assign multiple tags to this word to describe different attributes:

1. **Part of Speech Tag**: This tag identifies the grammatical category of the word.
   - Example: The word "word" can be tagged as a noun (N).

2. **Meaning Tag**: This provides the definition or a brief description of the word.
   - Example: For "word," the meaning tag could be something like "a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing."

3. **Pronunciation Tag**: This tag indicates how the word is pronounced.
   - Example: The pronunciation of "word" can be tagged using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as /wɜːrd/.

### Implementing Tags in Python

Here's a simple way to implement these tags in Python:

```python
# Define the word and its tags
word_info = {
    "word": "word",
    "part_of_speech": "Noun",
    "meaning": "A single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing",
    "pronunciation": "/wɜːrd/"
}

# Accessing the information
print(f"Word: {word_info['word']}")
print(f"Part of Speech: {word_info['part_of_speech']}")
print(f"Meaning: {word_info['meaning']}")
print(f"Pronunciation: {word_info['pronunciation']}")
```
