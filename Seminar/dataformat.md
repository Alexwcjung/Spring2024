# Data arrangement

Data arrangement in wide format and narrow format (also known as long format) refers to different ways of structuring and organizing data in a dataset, especially in the context of statistical analysis and data visualization. These formats are particularly relevant when dealing with repeated measures or multivariate data.

## 1. Wide Format
* Characteristics: In wide format, each subject (or observational unit) is typically represented by a single row, and each variable measured is in a separate column.
* Use Cases: This format is often more intuitive for data entry and can be more straightforward for certain types of analysis, especially those involving pairwise comparisons between variables.
* Example: Consider a dataset tracking blood pressure measurements for patients at three different time points. In wide format, each patient would have one row with columns for each time point (e.g., PatientID, BloodPressure_Time1, BloodPressure_Time2, BloodPressure_Time3).

| PatientID | BloodPressure_Time1 | BloodPressure_Time2 | BloodPressure_Time3 |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 001       | 120                 | 125                 | 130                 |
| 002       | 110                 | 115                 | 120                 |
| 003       | 130                 | 135                 | 140                 |


## 2. Narrow Format
+ Characteristics: In narrow (or long) format, each row represents a single observation, often a single time point or measurement, and usually includes columns to indicate the subject and the nature of the observation.
+ Use Cases: Narrow format is generally more amenable to analysis in many statistical software packages, particularly for repeated measures or time series data. It is also more flexible and can be easier to manage when dealing with varying numbers of observations per subject.
+ Example: Using the same blood pressure dataset, in narrow format, there would be multiple rows for each patient â€“ one for each time point. Columns might include PatientID, TimePoint, and BloodPressure.

| PatientID | TimePoint | BloodPressure |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| 001       | Time1     | 120           |
| 001       | Time2     | 125           |
| 001       | Time3     | 130           |
| 002       | Time1     | 110           |
| 002       | Time2     | 115           |
| 002       | Time3     | 120           |
| 003       | Time1     | 130           |
| 003       | Time2     | 135           |
| 003       | Time3     | 140           |


## Choosing the Format:
* Depends on Analysis: The choice of format can depend on the specific requirements of the statistical analysis or the preferences of the software being used.
* Trend Towards Narrow Format: There's a trend in data analysis favoring the narrow format, as it tends to be more consistent with the principles of tidy data, which posits that datasets are easier to manipulate and analyze when each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.
