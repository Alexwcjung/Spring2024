### Instructions

1. Explore online digital tools and artificial intelligence tools in groups, and select one or two that you believe would be effective for English learning activities.
2. Discuss how the selected tools can be utilized during class activities, such as group activities. Describe in detail and objectively how the selected digital tool can assist in English learning.
3. Create a 3-5 minute video explaining what activities can be done through the digital tool. The video should be made in English, using data and recordings, but you may use artificial intelligence tools.
