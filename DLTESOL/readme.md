## Course syllabus

üî∏Course overview:  
This introductory course is specifically designed for graduate students majoring in TESOL, aiming to equip them with the essential skills and knowledge in contemporary digital literacy. As we step into a digitally-driven era, the role of technology in language education becomes increasingly pivotal. This course addresses this transformation, focusing on how TESOL educators can effectively integrate digital tools into their teaching practices.

üî∏Key Objectives:  

1. **Understanding Digital Literacy**: We begin by exploring the concept of digital literacy, particularly its importance for language educators in the 21st century. Students will learn about the evolving landscape of digital technology in education and how it impacts language teaching and learning.

2. **Basic Coding Skills**: Recognizing the growing relevance of coding in educational contexts, the course provides an introduction to basic coding skills. This foundational knowledge will enable TESOL educators to understand and utilize various digital platforms and tools more effectively.

3. **Learner-Centered Digital Tools**: A significant part of the course is dedicated to identifying and utilizing digital tools for creating learner-centered or customized teaching materials. Students will learn to assess and apply these tools to design engaging and effective language learning experiences.

4. **Application Development for Language Learning**: The course will introduce simple methods of developing applications tailored to language learning. This includes an overview of user-friendly platforms that do not require advanced coding skills, enabling educators to create interactive and immersive learning environments.

5. **Exploring Contemporary AI Tools**: With the advent of AI in education, this course provides an insight into how AI tools can be leveraged in language teaching. We will explore current AI technologies, their applications in language education, and how they can benefit both teachers and learners.

6. **Ethical Considerations and Digital Citizenship**: As educators in the digital age, understanding the ethical implications of technology use in the classroom is crucial. This course will cover aspects of digital citizenship, privacy, and ethical use of digital resources in education.

By the end of this course, TESOL graduates will be well-equipped with the fundamental skills and knowledge to effectively incorporate digital literacy into their teaching practices. They will be prepared to navigate the digital landscape of language education, creating innovative, inclusive, and effective learning experiences for their students.

## Course assignments

üîµ Mini-Project #1: Digital Tool In-Class Activity Video

+ Objective: In groups, students will create a 5-minute video clip that showcases how to integrate available digital tools into in-class activities. The goal is to share innovative methods for enhancing language learning through technology and to evaluate the technologies with which teachers are already familiar.
+ Requirements:
  + Select digital tools that are applicable to TESOL settings.
  + Design an in-class activity that effectively incorporates the chosen digital tools.
  + Produce a 5-minute video presenting the activity, highlighting its learning objectives, implementation steps, and expected outcomes.
üîµ Mini-project #2: Language Learning App Development
+ Objective: Groups will design language learning activities and then use Python to code and develop a functional language learning application based on these activities.
+ Requirements:
  + Conceptualize a set of language learning activities suitable for TESOL students.
  + Ensure the activities are interactive, user-friendly, and educational.
  + Provide a brief documentation explaining the app‚Äôs features, usage instructions, and learning goals.
üîµ Final project: Lesson Demonstration with Language Apps
+ Utilizing the language applications and digital tools developed earlier, students will conduct a preview of a comprehensive lesson demonstration. This project aims to showcase the practical application of their created tools in a real-world teaching scenario. These assignments are designed to foster creativity, collaboration, and technical skills, preparing students for the digital demands of contemporary language teaching. Details will be announced in time.
