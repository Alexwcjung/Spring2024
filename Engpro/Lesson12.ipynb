        "    \"We are in page 67. Let me explain the rhythm characteristics in English.\",\n",
        "    \"Number one. In English, the rhythm and flow of speech are shaped significantly by how we emphasize certain words and how we speed through others. This distinctive pattern creates what we call the 'rhythm of English,' which stands in contrast to the rhythm found in languages like Korean.\",\n",
        "    \"English is known as a 'stress-timed' language. This means that the rhythm of speech is determined by the stress placed on certain words. In a sentence, content words such as nouns, main verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are typically emphasized. These words carry the core meaning of the sentence and are spoken with more force and clarity. For example, in the sentence 'I absolutely love eating apples,' the words 'absolutely,' 'love,' and 'apples' receive more emphasis, while the other words are spoken more quickly and with less stress.\",\n",
        "    \"On the other hand, function words like articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and auxiliary verbs are usually spoken more rapidly and weakly. These words glue the sentence together but do not carry the primary meaning. They are often reduced, making the speech flow smoothly and quickly.\",\n",
        "    \"Contrast this with Korean, which is a 'syllable-timed' language. In syllable-timed languages, each syllable is given approximately equal time and emphasis, creating a more even-paced rhythm throughout the sentence. This difference in rhythm can be challenging for learners when transitioning between the two languages, as it affects not only pronunciation but also listening comprehension.\",\n",
        "    \"Understanding the stress-timed nature of English is crucial for mastering its rhythm and intonation. It helps in speaking more naturally and being better understood by native speakers. Remember, it's not just what you say, but how you say it that conveys meaning in English.\",\n",
        "    \"Number two. Contractions, formed by combining two words together to form one, are commonly used in spoken English. \",\n",
        "    \"Number three. Using the full form of a contraction in conversation can make your speech sound unnatural, as full forms are generally reserved for formal speeches or when emphasizing specific words.\",\n",
        "    \"1. Contraction form: I'll be there. Full form: I will be there.\",\n",
        "    \"2. Contraction form: You're right. Full form: You are right.\",\n",
        "    \"3. Contraction form: He's smart. Full form: He is smart.\",\n",
        "    \"4. Contraction form: We've been through a lot. Full form: We have been through a lot.\",\n",
        "    \"5. Contraction form: It isn't right. Full form: It is not right.\",\n",
        "    \"6. Contraction form: It doesn't matter. Full form: It does not matter.\",\n",
        "    \"7. Contraction form: He hasn't eaten yet. Full form: He has not eaten yet.\",\n",
        "    \"8. Contraction form: That's right. Full form: That is right.\",\n",
